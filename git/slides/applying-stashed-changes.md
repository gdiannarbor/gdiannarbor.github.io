##  applying stashed changes

So let's say you do some work and then need those stashed changes back. We can get them back, it's super easy!

```bash
$ git stash apply
```

Now check your `helloWorld.js`

<p class="terminal fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><code>helloWorld.js</code></p>

```javascript
this won't even compile!
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Our terrible code is back! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
