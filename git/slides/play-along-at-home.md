##  Play along at home

I will be spoon-feeding you terminal commands today. When I do, they will look like this:
<!-- .element: class="align-left"  -->

```bash
$ git example-command --flag -f
```

(The dollar sign ($) is your terminal's prompt. You don't need to type that. That's just a convention.)
<!-- .element: class="align-left"  -->

```bash
$ type these commands exactly
$ # Anything after a hashtag is a comment
```
<br>

When I give you more than one command, you will enter each command and press enter at the end of each line
<!-- .element: class="align-left"  -->
