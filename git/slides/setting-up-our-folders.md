##  setting up our folders

We will create a directory in which to keep all our work from today. To make sure we all stay together, we will start from the same place.
```bash
$ cd ~ #moves us to the HOME directory
```

<br>

Now create a new directory for all the projects from this class. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
```bash
$ mkdir gdi-git
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<br>

Now no matter where we navigate during class we can easily return to this folder using this command. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

```bash
$ cd ~/gdi-git #moves us to our class work folder
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
