##  back tracking

Before we start using the new commands we need to make sure we are back in our demo directory. Remember you changed directories to do the in-class exercise.

<br>

We set up everyone's demo project to reside in the same place to make it easy to return. Just run this command:

<br>

```bash
$ cd ~/gdi-git/git-cmd-demos
```
(Don't forget you can use tab to autocomplete)
