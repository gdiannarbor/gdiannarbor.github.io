##  Add a new file to our repo

You can add new files to the project:

Let's create a file called &lt;your-name&gt;.js in our `git-cmd-demos` repo, add it to the repo (stage it), and commit it. While we're at it, let's put it in its own new directory.

```bash
$ mkdir names
$ touch names/james.js
```
