##  using git log

Using this command is very simple.

```bash
$ cd ~/gdi-git #back in our class project folder
$ git log
```
Pressing enter will allow you to see more of the log line by line.

In some terminals you may have press `q` to exit the log. If you don't have your terminal prompt (`$` or `>`), try pressing `q`.
