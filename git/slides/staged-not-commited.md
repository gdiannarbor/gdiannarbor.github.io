##  staged, not commited

So far we've created the repo, created, and staged some new files. But we haven't actually 'saved' them to the repo. Right now they're just what we refer to as Staged.

<br>

There are basically 4 states in which a file can exist.

1. Untracked (not included in the repo)
2. Tracked
3. Changed
4. Staged
5. Commited (same as #2)
