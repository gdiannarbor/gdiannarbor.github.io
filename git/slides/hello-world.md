##  hello world!

We will not be doing any programming in this workshop. However we will need to make some simple changes to some files so our version control can take notice and track those changes when we tell it to do so.

<br>

Open your `helloWorld.js` file in a simple text editor. I like Sublime Text but you can use the text editor of your choice.

<br>

TextEdit for OSX || Notepad for Windows.

<br>
<p class='terminal'><code>helloWorld.js</code></p>
```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```
