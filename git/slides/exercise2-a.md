#### `Develop It!`
##  Time for another hands-on exercise!

### Setup:

`cd` to our top-level folder for this class

```bash
$ cd ~/gdi-git #moves us to our class work folder
```

Remember how to check where you are by using the `pwd` command

```bash
$ pwd #print working directory
```

```bash
/Users/jyork/Documents/git/gdi-git
```
