#### `Develop It!`
##  practice git revert

1. Make another change to file
2. Save it.
3. Commit it.
4. Revert the most recent commit.
5. Verify success by checking your `git log`. If successful you should have a new commit which reverts one before. And the changes to the file (from step 1) should be gone.
