##  Testing the ssh connection

Hopefully, you'll get a slightly scary looking message that looks something like this.

```bash
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.252.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
Just type `yes`
