##  detached HEAD state

When you checkout a commit you enter what's called 'detached HEAD state'. You can't keep any commits in this state as you're not on a branch (more on that later). So any commits you make while checking out a past commit will be marooned unless you stash them (more on THAT later) or move them to another branch.
