##  using git stash

When last we left our intrepid heroes they were off checking out old commits. Let's bring them home, make some changes, and stash them to see what happens.

```bash
$ git checkout master #sets you back to master
```
Let's change our helloWorld.js file:

<p class="terminal fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><code>helloWorld.js</code></p>

```javascript
this won't even compile!
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

(Make sure to replace the entire contents of the file)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
