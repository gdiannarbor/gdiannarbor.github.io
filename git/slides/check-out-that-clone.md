##  check out that clone

Now if you check the contents of the class folder, you should see a copy of the `git-demo` project in there.

```bash
$ ls -al
```

Even cooler, because `git-demo` is a project with git as it's source control. It's already it's own repo, ready to be commited to, added to, pushed/pulled, etc. Have a look.
