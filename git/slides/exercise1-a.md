#### `Develop It!`
###  Time for our first hands-on exercise!

#### `Setup`:

`cd` to our top-level folder for this class

```bash
$ cd ~/gdi-git #moves us to our class work folder
```

You can check where you are by using the `pwd` command

```bash
$ pwd #print working directory
```

You should see something like this...
```bash
/Users/jyork/Documents/git/gdi-git
```
As long as you have that `gdi-git` on the end you're in good shape
